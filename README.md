# BetterBuild

**ATTENTION:** This plugin manipulates the server extensively. This plugin is only made for better building experience and shouldn't be used for other things.

But what does it do?
  - Opens an inventory for world management
  - Opens an inventory to create custom banners
  - Manipulates the physics of worlds
  - Manages a users permissions to build (adds a build-mode)
  - Manipulates many Minecraft-Events for better building experience
